<p class="center no-indent">BLESSED BE THE DOG</p>

<p class="drop-cap">My dog has but one eye. He was the beginning
of things. Just how far he has
controlled my destiny, just how far he has
shaped the lives of those about him, will
never be known until the dull human mind
has evolved a keener perception of the real
values of life and has learned to become
conscious of influences too subtle to be
recognized by man in his present fallen
estate. This is certain: he was the beginning
of things. It was he who opened the
door and led the way.</p>

<p>I have always felt that I owe that dog
an apology which only a life of devotion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
can express. The bitter truth is—I bought
him. What I paid for him is one of those
personal secrets which will remain locked
in my bosom to the end of time. It is one
of those sacred things that even an Internal
Revenue Inspector must dismiss in reverent
awe, and the Head of the Household
must rest content with the explanation that
there are but two hidden things in my life:
one is the price paid for the dog in question
and the other is the extent of my devotion
to my wife. After the matter is presented in
these terms, further inquiry seems indelicate.</p>

<p>But the bitter fact remains—I did buy
him. A dog should never be purchased,
should never be made the subject of barter
and dickering. A dog may be rescued from
abuse, he may be bestowed and accepted
as a gift, he may be borrowed and never
returned, he may be found and kept, and,
in cases of real necessity, he may be stolen
in a dignified manner; but he should never
be bought. I have heard of men who make
a livelihood from the purchase and sale of
dogs. I can conceive of them as good husbands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
and kind fathers, but they still seem
to me inhuman monsters, engaged in a
sinister traffic.</p>

<p>There seems to be one relationship in a
social structure now completely dissected
and exposed under the microscope of social
investigators, which remains inviolate—a
relationship which owes its immunity
from investigators to the stupidity characteristic
of investigators who ignore the
significant and tear the obvious and unimportant
into worthless tatters. That
relationship is the profoundly significant
one existing between a good, bad, or
indifferent child and a dog.</p>

<p>With what wealth of ritual do we bestow
a name upon a child; with what ecstasies
of formality do we celebrate her taking a
mate; and yet with what casual indifference
do we give that child the first dog!
We create a contact—as our scientific
friends like to call it—the importance of
which no one can conjecture, with a callous
unconcern that is the only proper measure
of our ignorance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>Here if anywhere is an excuse for formality
and the most elaborate and significant
ritual. Here is a real chance for genuine
good cheer and the sincerest merrymaking,
quite unlike that forced and somewhat
doubting hilarity that characterizes the
average marriage-feast. For in this case
we perform the one act allowed us in this
earthly pilgrimage in which we are sure to
be right: we cannot make a mistake. And
certainly when that crowning moment of
our existence comes—when as in the fairy
tale we make the one wish allowed us—we
should do it with a high degree of decorum
and with all decent elaboration of detail.</p>

<p>I say we cannot make a mistake—I
mean from the child’s standpoint. We may
create a relationship trying to the dog, by
giving him to a very inferior child upon
whom he must lavish years of loving instruction
before improvement appears, but
we cannot hurt the child by giving him a
bad dog, for the simple reason that there
is no such thing, broadly speaking, as a
bad dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>There is the occasional dog, of course,
who has not withstood the corrupting influences
of human associations as well as
his more fortunate brothers, but even he is
vastly better than no dog at all.</p>

<p>And once the contact made, the relationship
established, what unlimited vistas of
speculation lie temptingly before the reflective
mind! Those two little figures on
the hearthrug—one in the image of man,
one showing the sleek and perfect lines of a
half-wild creature. Two heads together—one
of tousled gold, the other close-cropped
and tapering to nostrils of nervous sensitiveness;
a relaxed and callous paw held
firmly in a dimpled human hand. What are
they saying to each other? What lies back
of those limpid canine eyes, half closed to
the glare and warmth of the hearthstone?
Something is going on between them, some
delicate transmission of emotion, thought,
or stimulus, which we know is infinitely
good for the soul of the child and we can
hope does no harm to the dog.</p>

<p>An unfamiliar footstep is heard, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
picture changes. The relaxed and languid
creature is transformed in an instant from
a musing, tolerant playmate to a bristling
bundle of potential destruction. He stands,
alert and vibrant, muscles tense, set for any
contingency, ready for any emergency and
any sacrifice. The emergency passes, and
with an apologetic shake to relieve the tension
of his muscles and a half-sneeze to clear
the dryness of expectant fangs, he settles
once more upon the hearthrug, to resume
his mystic communion with the only person
in the household with whom he is on terms
of complete mutual understanding.</p>

<p>These are the perfect hours of childhood
and doghood. They pass, like all perfect
things, and are followed by long hours of
separation, while the child is absent in one
of those institutions ingeniously contrived
to remove him from the priceless opportunities
of improvement in the society of a
dog and to lighten the duties of idle parents,
in exchange for a fleeting familiarity with
what is cryptically called the “l.c.d.” And
while the child is incarcerated in one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
those centres of juvenile infection what
prodigies of patience does the dog perform!</p>

<p>In my own case there happen to be two
avenues of return from these dreary absences,
and for long before the hour of arrival
they must be watched. Owing to the
entire absence of one eye this is a delicate
operation, but Cerberus has found one point
where with the least muscular exertion he
can sweep his tiny horizon with his one remaining
eye. And so he waits—not with
the imbecile nervous tension and restless
pacing of his master, but relaxed and
resting.</p>

<p>Suddenly he becomes alert. The peculiar
rattle of a certain rear wheel on a certain
automobile is recognized by those miraculous
ears long before the solitary eye can
see the car. He is off—the long vigil is
over. Once more life is sweet and full of
interest and adventure.</p>

<p>It is idle to prate of the lessons he teaches.
They have been told and retold. Patience,
loyalty, devotion—we know them all. It
is in the finer shades of his relationship with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
those about him that his quality appears.
His is a wonderful life. Countless hours are
spent in investigation. Every nook and
cranny, every tree and every stone, every
dark and mysterious hole, every living creature
in pasture, garden, or stable must be
run to earth. What sort of data is he
gathering, I wonder? What use does he
make of it? I do not know; but it is being
stored away and tabulated for future reference
in a vastly more usable and convenient
form than any card index devised by
the bungling brain of his master.</p>

<p>These are the busy hours of dog life.
How often we encounter him bent on some
important errand! I have a friend, the only
adult I ever met who really knows a dog—and
by the same token he is that rare thing,
the gentleman. He too enjoys a long and
solitary tramp, and he often meets on the
highways and in the wood paths his various
canine acquaintances bent on matters of
importance. He makes a practice of saluting
them with a cordial but respectful
“Good morning” or “Good afternoon,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
with perhaps a passing allusion to the fine
weather. This by way of tribute to a fellow
creature with mutual tastes.</p>

<p>But Cerberus knows that all work and
no play is a dangerous method of life, and
so hours are devoted to recreation. The
duties of guardianship and the demands of
education are laid aside, and he shows us
how to play. Madly, intently, with no
thought of appearances, he rushes into play,
preferably with others but alone if necessary;
and the simplest things suffice—a
stick, a stone, a floating bit of feather is all
he needs. No elaborate toy, no calculated
programme, no long planning, no arguments
and disagreements as to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terminus ad
quem</i>, resulting in half-hearted enjoyment
or utter boredom (the usual result of human
recreations), nothing but utter abandonment
to the pleasure of the moment. I
envy Cerberus his play more than I ever
envied my neighbor’s laboriously acquired
and oppressive wealth.</p>

<p>Play over, then comes rest—rest as complete
and perfect as the play. Stretched on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
the grass or before the fire, relaxed and
languid, every muscle slack and every nerve
quiet, he sinks to slumber profound and
absolute. Sometimes a bit of joyous memory
steals into his slumbering mind; an ear will
cock, a paw will twitch, but for an instant,
and he is again at perfect peace.</p>

<p>Then the call will come. Duty summons
in the form of some sound inaudible to
human ears, some suspicious odor too delicate
to disturb a human nostril, and he is
up. Back in harness, recreated, rested, ready
for any demand upon that marvelous supply
of nervous energy. And a neurasthenic
generation wonders at it, while Cerberus
patiently tries to teach by actual practice
the simplest rudiments of health to a stupid
and inattentive class of grown-up dunces.</p>

<p>That much vaunted and greatly overestimated
thing called intellectual life, which
humans use as a convenient excuse for all
sorts of self-indulgence, is to Cerberus only
the nice adjustment of dog data, knowledge,
and experience to the needs of his complex
relationships with those about him. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
adjustments are delicate and intricate, for
Cerberus lives, moves, and has his being,
not in a world of understanding fellow-dogs,
but with creatures duller than he and filled
with every form of prejudice and conceit.
Add to this the fact that these same folk
represent to him not men and women, but
for all practical purposes of immediate
recognition and other important dog-matters
nothing more nor less than a moving
forest of male and female legs. How would
you prosper, my proud dog-baiting relative,
if your point of view was from eight to
fifteen inches above ground, and if your
horizon line could be extended beyond a
few paltry yards only by a painful lifting of
the head or the securing of some vantage
point for observation? I fear, my friend,
you would cut a much sadder figure than
Cerberus at his worst.</p>

<p>And so his days pass. They are full of
work and rest and play and, above all, a
constant effort to square his dog mind to
a man world. He does it pretty well; he
does it better, on the whole, than man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
squares his to a God-made world. At least,
his effort seems more sincere, his attitude
vastly more dignified and honest.</p>

<p>The day’s work is over. Childish hands
are clasped in slumber, maternal cares are
soothed in the first sweet sleep of night,
and paternal irritabilities are in the process
of partial elimination by pipe and book and
armchair and open fire.</p>

<p>Cerberus lies with his head across his
master’s foot, a convenient arrangement allowing
contact to replace sight on the blind
side; and the seeing side commands the
door. The autumn wind sways bare
branches against the tiny house. Faint
odors of apples and other products of the
little farm seep up from the cellar, where
in modest store they flank the winter’s firewood
piled in orderly array. The year is
dying. Cerberus stirs in his sleep. I lay
my hand upon his lean side. I pause to feel
the rapid beating of his little heart, scarcely
slowed at all, even in sleep. Would that
some power could slow it down; it will wear
out all too soon—and then!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>A door creaks. He rises; no bristling fury,
no growling menace, only an orderly and
methodical investigation of every corner of
the room and hall. Then a dignified return
and sleep resumed. A subtle compliment
to his master’s competence, a mere gesture
of coöperation with a trusted superior—this
is one of those delicate adjustments of
dog life to a man-made world. Of these
Cerberus is a past master.</p>

<p>He sleeps. His “trusted superior” glances
at the title of the book he reads and lays
it on the table. No need to read now, when
Cerberus teaches. The book is a scholarly
treatise on <em>The Mastery of Nerves</em>.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">BLESSED BE THE PIG</p>

<p class="drop-cap">My neighbor has many broad acres upon
which he pays the taxes and over which I
ride and walk—an admirable arrangement.
He likes to pay taxes and I like to ride where
the footing is soft and the paths are shaded.
This is only one of the many advantages
which I possess in having so amiable and
excellent a man for a neighbor.</p>

<p>To be sure, his orbit is a bit more extended
than mine, and we meet but seldom. He
nevertheless adds enormously to my pleasure,
for his manner of life is ornamental
and leisured. He does things suavely and
without hurry. His surroundings suit him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
admirably, and when he takes tea in the
garden, dressed in spotless riding-togs, he
is every inch the picture he thinks he is.</p>

<p>My somewhat covert admiration of his
sartorial perfection has been a bit marred,
however, by a suspicion that his life was not
one of full-flavored and perfect rusticity. It
seemed too perfect in detail, just a bit studied.
A tumble-down stone wall separates my
entire estate from one corner of his domain.
It is not a well-preserved or suburban looking
wall. I know it is my duty to repair it.
I mean to sometime. Over this wall on rare
occasions we hold conversation, and it was
while thus engaged that I unwittingly discovered
his secret. I had said something
about pigs and, not wishing to appear
superior or improperly proud of my worldly
possessions, I inquired as to how his pigs
“did”—pigs are one of the few animals
who “do.” To my surprise, he told me that
he did not keep pigs, not even a pig; in fact,
he would not tolerate one on his place. Then
I knew his secret, I realized the flaw in his
pretentious rusticity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>I turned and walked sadly away. There
are times when people reveal themselves so
shamelessly and in such bland innocence of
the awful revelations they make that the
kindest thing you can do is to leave them in
ignorance of their guilt.</p>

<p>Then a disquieting thought came to me:
if Midas dislikes pigs so much, perhaps he
dislikes mine, and wishes them removed.
Perhaps he meant to go on and make the
suggestion. It was well that I left him. I
hastened my step lest he call me back.</p>

<p>Presently I found myself in earnest contemplation
of the creatures held in so low
esteem by my neighbor. I looked tenderly
at them. I recognized the mood: it was the
familiar one that is experienced when you
hold in your hand a most unflattering report
from your eldest’s preceptor, and the tiny
culprit stands before you waiting the utterance
of reprimand or sentence. This mood,
by some strange twist in my mind, always
prompts immoderate and boisterous laughter,
which must be restrained in the family
circle; but to-day I was safely out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
hearing. My neighbor was taking tea by
now in an ornate and inaccessible garden,
and I found myself shaken with Homeric
laughter as I leaned over the low wall
and shared my merriment with two most
astonished pigs.</p>

<p>Of course Midas would not keep a pig! I
might have known it. Midas chops trees in
a silk shirt. That in itself is not inherently
base or sordid, but he grunts (it is not a
pretty word, but he does) when his axe
strikes the tree or log he is man-handling in
an utterly inaccurate imitation of a real
chopper with a real axe striking real blows.
He fails to synchronize properly and betrays
the amateur. I have even heard him describe
a pack of hounds as “dogs”! I was not
thinking pleasant thoughts of Midas. I did
not try to; I knew I was through with him.
Our wives might continue to exchange biennial
calls, we might even exchange a word or
two over the wall, but for all intents and
purposes I knew I was through with Midas.
How silly I had been—of course Midas
would not keep a pig.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>And what a pity! By one of those wise
provisions of a benign Providence this
crowning glory of rusticity is within the
reach of the humblest, except those unfortunates
who dwell in congested districts
where a perverse public opinion has legislated
against this highly useful animal. But
then, no self-respecting person would live
in such a place anyway.</p>

<p>There is no need to enlarge upon the economic
value of the pig. The billboards and
the press are radiant with tasteful illustrations
of the appetizing final state of this succulent
animal. It is in other ways and for
other reasons that I admire and love him.</p>

<p>He is the one animal with which man can
ever hope to be on intimate terms, who is an
incorrigible wag. He is the humorist of the
farm. It seems strange that it should be so.
Bred for countless generations for nothing
but culinary purposes, daily approaching an
inevitably tragic end, he has preserved inviolate
the comic tradition. When opportunity
presents, my friend, look attentively at
those little, glittering eyes and you will see a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
waggish twinkle that will convince you that
you are in the presence of a humorist.</p>

<p>To get the very best out of your ownership
of a pig, thought should be given to his habitat.
An enclosure is necessary. Now then;
have the enclosure of such a height that
your elbows rest comfortably upon the top,
arrange a soft and agreeable footing on the
windward side of the enclosure, and all will
be well. Your relation with a pig is not an
intimate one; he is not to be handled except
in early infancy; and you will find that
merely to contemplate him, as you stand in
a comfortable and relaxed attitude with some
support to the body, will yield a rich reward.</p>

<p>They should be secured young. There is
in a very young pig an innocent joyousness
that will amuse you in the early stages of
your acquaintance and will give you food
for thought as your intimacy grows. And
then the pleasure of seeing them grow! If
you have a low and commercial type of
mind you can calculate daily your profit,
even after deducting the interest on your
modest initial investment. The upkeep is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
not a heavy item. One of the most charming
things about a pig is his heartfelt gratitude
for the delicacies which a wasteful and ignorant
generation regard as inappropriate for
human consumption; and to beneficent
use he puts them, returning literally an
hundredfold.</p>

<p>But it is not these sordid considerations
that lead me to love a pig. It is the intellectual
sympathy existing between us that
endears him to me.</p>

<p>In the first place; a pig, more than any
of your other animal friends, looks like
many people you know. The moment you
see a new pig you have at once a dozen
names in mind, every one of them fitting
perfectly. I will admit that I have encountered
a curious prejudice on the part of some
people against having a pig named after
them. This can be remedied in a simple and
most effective manner. In my case, I have
a pig that irresistibly reminded me of a near
relative, a man of pronounced opinions.
That settled his name. On formal occasions
and for reference in certain quarters I use a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
coldly classic name with no special significance;
but at the twilight hour, when that
pig and I hold communion, I address him by
his lawful given name.</p>

<p>I have had pigs who possessed a variety of
aliases. In such a case, as I talk pleasantly
with one or the other, I go through the list
until I use the one name I know to be his by
every right of pigship. An ear pricks up, a
roguish eye twinkles a bit more brightly, and
after a delicately executed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pas seul</i> around
the enclosure, he is back once more, demure
and attentive.</p>

<p>And how attentive he is! He stands with
ears erect, fore feet firmly planted in the
empty trough, his little eyes raised to mine,
and his nostrils twitching with interest and
anticipation. In that posture he is the living
image of a lady I know, as she leans over her
teacup to catch the last syllable of innuendo
in the last titbit of scandal that is making its
rapid circuit of our little town. So I address
my remarks to Mrs. Jones, and relate to her
incidents in the lives of mutual friends no
less apocryphal than those so much enjoyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
by my neighbors. And Mrs. Jones’ eyes
twinkle, and her nose twitches, and her tail
curls tighter and tighter in sheer delight,
until I burst into laughter with a guilty fear
that I may have been overheard—may
have so set in motion a new series of stories
that would inevitably bring disaster to some
of our most respected townsfolk.</p>

<p>There is a direct simplicity about a pig.
He knows no affectations. He has but two
ends in view: one is to wax fat,—and how
splendidly he does it,—the other, to amuse
with a subtle, ironic humor. He lives a
curiously circumscribed life in utter and
absolute contentment. He has none of that
nervous intellectual intensity that is so
wearing to live with. He has no illusions; he
indulges in no moods or fancies; but what a
wonderful companion he is—the very
flower of discretion! Your most intimate
confidences are safe with him.</p>

<p>The older he grows, the more closely in
his stately prime does he resemble the president
of our local bank until, at times of
financial stringency, I can hardly bring myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
to visit him. I know if he could speak
he would say something about an impending
overdraft. He knows it too, and as he waddles
over toward me he puffs and grunts a
bit in covert imitation of the great man
whom he knows I fear. I am quick to act on
his suggestion. It suits my mood. There are
plans afoot which will soon necessitate a
visit to that temple of finance. It will be
well to be letter-perfect in my part, though
I know from experience that my part in the
dialogue will be unimportant, once it gets
under way.</p>

<p>The visit starts with an effusive welcome,
as Moneybags extends a moist and yielding
hand. A wan smile flits for a moment across
his impassive countenance, and the judicial
manner is once more assumed. How
are things with me? Well, he hopes. But at
times like these it is difficult to tell—very
difficult. A faint note of pessimism already
begins to creep into the monologue. General
business conditions are unsatisfactory;
there has been overproduction in certain
industrial lines; the situation in the Near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
East is not what he would like to have it.
Dark hints of revolution and tottering governments,
of an uncomfortable feeling in
Wall Street, lead naturally to a detailed
description of the appalling condition of the
farmer (here I begin to be sympathetic), due
to the presence of either too much or too
little gold in the country, and I am newly
impressed by the unfortunate circumstance
that I either am or am not a citizen of a
debtor nation. I do not quite know which it
is, but it is dreadful, whatever it is, and I
find myself suddenly filled with compunction
that I should have come to this noble,
suffering person with my paltry needs. I
begin to see dimly that I am only adding a
feather’s weight to the staggering load that
this self-forgetful Atlas is already carrying,
as single-handed he supports the financial
fabric of the world.</p>

<p>Moneybags pauses, a chubby hand plays
nervously with a delicate ivory paper-cutter.
He glances apprehensively at the
door; his voice becomes a husky whisper as
he alludes to general conditions of unrest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
among the working classes, their utter lack
of appreciation of what is being done for
them, and the certainty that things will be
worse before they are better. Long ago my
little errand has been forgotten in a flood of
sympathy for a man so harried by world
problems.</p>

<p>At this point Moneybags observes a delicate
morsel in a far corner of the trough and
he moves away to investigate. It proves
attractive, and he forgets me in his efforts to
secure it. It is well, for at that moment we
are joined by the companion of his sequestered
life. It is Mrs. Murphy, the excellent
woman who does the cleaning and other important
matters in the little house yonder.</p>

<p>She comes abruptly; her manner has none
of the poise and dignity which have always
endeared her companion to me. She is vocal,
she is positive, she knows what she wants
and goes after it with commendable directness.
I fear she is, like myself, hopelessly
middle-class. But I like her. It is a relief to
converse again with a pig who talks my
language and with whom I have much in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
common. For Mrs. Murphy and I have
many mutual interests—taxes, interest,
mortgages, plumbers’ bills, insurance premiums,
indigent relatives, and growing
children.</p>

<p>The talk turns to other channels. Things
are not well with Mrs. Murphy; her rent
has been raised on account of conditions in
the Near East, there has been illness, food is
very dear. I try to explain to her that this
is due entirely to unsettled conditions in
Russia, but without great success.</p>

<p>Her sister’s children—oh yes, they are
with her. Yes, six of them. The two eldest
are in an “institooshun.” Thomas will
soon be at work, she hopes. Her lord and
master is just at present unemployed, but as
soon as he comes out of the hospital he hopes
to get half-time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy glides easily from the concrete
to the abstract. It is the rich who are
to blame. They are growing richer, and the
poor poorer. She looks scornfully at the
towers of the palace beyond the stone wall.
I hasten to tell her that we are not on terms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
now, that I too am out of sympathy with
Midas. She seems appeased.</p>

<p>I try to remember all the dreadful things
Moneybags told me. It is no use. Moneybags
was right. The working classes do not,
will not understand; but I have a suspicion
that Mrs. Murphy and I do not quite understand
Midas and Moneybags.</p>

<p>A joyous bark is heard. Shrill voices
pierce the air. School is over and life really
begins. I leave this oddly assorted pair to
work out their problems, grateful for an
hour of perfect peace in the presence of
perfect understanding.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Finally, a pig is the only animal friend
with whom I am able to part at an appropriate
time without bitter grief and self-reproaches.
It is not that I am not sincerely
attached to him by the subtlest ties of kinship,
but there seems to be only one logical
finale of our life together. If the parting is
delayed too long, the relationship loses
something of its old-time zest, the flower is
fading, and dull and apathetic habit replaces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
the first sweet fervor of fellowship. It
is well to let the parting come in proper season
without vain regrets. And even after
the parting there is opportunity for affectionate
remembrance. Your breakfast takes
on a new and interesting significance. As the
delicate morsel rests before you, you inhale
its subtle aroma, you see the slender stripes
of delicate color, and you wonder—you
wonder—</p>

<p>The pig has a secure niche in the Temple
of Letters. The gentle Elia has enshrined
him for all time. But by a curious chance
even Elia emphasized the gastronomic aspect
of his fame without reference to his
waggish quality. It is well that the benign
Dr. Dolittle has placed before us his true
picture in Gub-Gub, beloved of children.</p>

<p>And now, my friend, the fever of the day
is over. The twilight hour has come with its
suggestion of peace and contemplation.
Come with me and we will rest awhile. Let
me introduce you to a friend of mine, a
person of importance in local financial and
social circles. He will amuse you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>And when you reach that time in your life
when you begin to suffer from the chronic
irritability of the man over fifty, when you
begin to get a bit queer, and quarrel with
your neighbor simply because he wears
expensive and becoming raiment, when you
need a solace and an unfailing source of
understanding fellowship, when you begin
to feel the need of occasional soul-communings
with Nature’s subtlest humorist and
most perfect clown, apply to me; I will sell
you a pig. And, having dined at your table,
I know he will “do” well.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">BLESSED BE THE HEN</p>

<p class="drop-cap">There dawns a day when the big rock to
the south of the stable looms black against
the shrinking snowdrifts. A crumbling
Gibraltar stands beneath the apple trees, its
turrets wasted by the sun, its massive walls
fast melting to decay. Gone is its grandeur;
gone are its brave defenders; no sign of them
remains save one scarlet gauntlet, lost in
repelling the last desperate sally of a departed
foe, now the sodden and solitary
reminder of an epic winter.</p>

<p>A strange new life is stirring within the
little house. Steps are quicker, voices gayer;
new tasks come with every hour. A joyous
restlessness sets life a-tingle; windows open,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
and mops are shaken. Curious caps appear
over familiar female faces. All is bustle,
eagerness, and mirth.</p>

<p>Outside, great rich black spots of earth
appear. The first green things look out from
garden tangles, and the sun pours its prodigal
warmth into every dark and frozen corner.</p>

<p>There dawns a day set by no calendar, decreed
by no lawgiver, when the mystic ritual
of spring must be observed. Long since
have fireside tasks and recreations been a
mockery. Long since a strange and willful
discontent has set us all on edge. For many
days the leaping blood in little bodies had
been ringing out its imperious command;
and yet it was not time. Then at last we
know the time has come.</p>

<p>With perfect understanding we set forth.
Down through the land new-ploughed last
fall, by the willows with their magic mist of
spring, through the pine woods where snowbanks
still lie purple in the hollows about the
giant trunks, on to the river bank.</p>

<p>There it lies before us at full flood, lazily
rafting its harvest of broken ice to the sea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
not far away. Where the sun lies warm the
bank is open, and the black water curls at
our feet with little intimate chuckles of
delight.</p>

<p>We follow the well-known path. No words
are needed, no shouted directions or commands,
until in a bend of the stream we reach
our goal. Sharp knives whip out. The tender
branches are bent gently down, and with
a clear, firm cut the sprays fall at our feet.
Not many—just enough to place with reverent
hands in a certain place in a certain
room. Our little store is divided into three
exactly equal parts, and each bearing his
share, we turn toward home. Now tongues
are loosed and once more the litany of spring
is chanted. Home in the half light of the
afternoon, back to lights and warmth, but
it is not the same. We feel a presence. The
dark, outside, is friendly; the warm wind no
longer sobs in the chimney top; the lights lie
soft on the sleek gray tufts of the willow
branches in the big green vase.</p>

<p>We all know what the morrow will bring
forth, but we do not like to talk about it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
We hint at something of rare significance,
but our talk just skirts the edges of direct
allusion. It must be done as always done
before: no variation, no vulgar interpolations
or changes, no deviation from accepted and
time-honored tradition. All is in readiness
and all will be well.</p>

<p>The morning dawns. There is no haste,
all is decency and order. But when the sun
is warm, once more with high intent we seek
the open. Down the little avenue, past the
pear trees to the stable, past the paddock,
through a tiny gate to a low, long building
near a shabby wall.</p>

<p>The doors are closed, the windows
screened with cotton cloth. We pause to
listen and hear busy scratching and muffled
talk. Down the long yard, enclosed by wire
netting, to the gate—a bit awry and uncertain
on its hinges, but bravely has it withstood
the wintry winds. We fumble at the
wooden button that holds it fast. The gate
opens and we stand aside.</p>

<p>A moment’s tense silence while the world
waits. Then the Duke of Wellington appears,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
resplendent in his spring apparel.
With shrewd, inquiring eyes he cocks his
head, and his great red wattles shake with
eagerness. A step nearer, and then he
speaks. A brief word of command, and out
from crowded winter quarters come the
ladies of his household. With the Field
Marshal in the van they reach the gate.
Another moment of inquiry and then, with
feet high lifted and yellow toes curled close,
they take the first step of the year in the
great outdoors. We count them as they
pass. We exchange knowing glances. All
present or accounted for, save one. We
know which one, and so we wait. It is but a
moment when, with shrill cries of alarm
and many aimless tackings, the delinquent
appears. Yes, it’s Mrs. Cuttle, always
anxious, always late, always perturbed and
scolding violently. True to form she begins
the season. Mrs. Cuttle has long since outlived
her productive years, but she is retained
as a moral lesson, and it is not lost: to
“cuttle” is a cardinal sin. May her anxious,
vociferous life be spared for years to come,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
sobeit she will only continue to impress on
all the vacuity of “cuttling.”</p>

<p>The Field Marshal now has his forces
deployed as skirmishers, and like the prudent
commander that he is, takes his place
well in the rear, where with all-pervading
eye he watches the rank and file. They are
locating and examining each bit of bare
ground, Mrs. Cuttle keeping her place in
line with great difficulty and greater uncertainty.
We listen for the food song. There
are those who pretend that a hen possesses
no vocabulary. Dull the ears that cannot
hear her endless variations of a simple
theme. The food song, a long succession of
monosyllabic interrogatives, is one of her
most endearing performances. Now it comes
to us, and we know the quest is rewarded.
We gather closer and watch the Field Marshal.
The moment will be here soon. Will
the ceremony be complete? Will it close
with the usual crashing crescendo that we
love?</p>

<p>He steps proudly along; he pauses, looks
about, the sun gleaming on the noble iris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
of his neck. He steps to an upturned clod
of earth and balances delicately on it.
Slowly his wings begin to move. He is
erect, noble, effulgent. His wings flap
wildly, he throws back his head, and with
comb and wattles blazing in apoplectic
ecstasy, he sounds the clarion call. It rings
in our ears, it tingles in our blood. It is more
than the fitting climax of a perfect drama;
it is the call to action. Tasks await us,
enthralling undertakings, and we must not
delay. But delay we do, for a moment to
feel the glowing warmth of the heightening
sun, to let the sweet southwest wind blow
in our faces, to smell the cool, wet odor of
the awakening soil.</p>

<p>We listen in the stillness for a voice.
Eager eyes turn toward the willows, parted
lips and straining ears wait for the message,
and it comes. The little brook beyond the
willows now is free and he is talking to us!</p>

<p>But now to work. First the tools must be
collected from strange hiding-places, boards
and nails, pails and brushes, all the jovial
paraphernalia of building and repairing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
The deserted henhouse is cleaned in every
corner: nests and roosts, floor and ceiling.
What glorious dust, what proud disdain of
clothes and hands, what prodigies of skill
and strength mark the full sweep of our
enterprise! New litter on the floor, new hay
in the nests, windows washed, and screens
removed. By night the returning wanderers
find all in order.</p>

<p>But this has been only one day; we know
more glorious ones will follow. As the days
go by we work more slowly, for we must not
spend these golden hours too freely.</p>

<p>Then all is ready. There must be a dry,
warm day with just a breath of wind. Pails
are brought and we mix the magic brew:
pure white lime, bubbling and steaming.
The cauldrons simmer; we stir and mumble
strange enchantments, old magic words of
bygone ages; we croon strange songs, and
stir, and stir. It is finished—whiter than
anything imagined, smooth as velvet; there
is nothing like it.</p>

<p>Inside we go. We put it on in lavish manner.
It drops; it spots; it spatters; and it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
burn if you are unwary. We emerge exultant.
For once we have had enough of
something, and how we have reveled in it!
A general appraisal of our clothes is made,
and bad as they are, we are sure they are not
so bad as they were last year.</p>

<p>Happy in the completion of this undertaking,
we rest awhile. For days we glory
in the matchless product of our skill, but we
know this leisure must not last. That is the
great fact at the bottom of man’s devotion
to the hen. She is an insistent creature and
goads you on to activity. She demands an
industry equal to her own. There are only
brief, infrequent periods of contemplative
pleasure in your association with a hen.
No hours of easy talk, no placid silences, no
moments of tender abstraction. A hen does
not sentimentalize, she acts, and she insists
that your relationship be that of a working
partner; but how richly she rewards the
conscientious performance of your duty
to her!</p>

<p>Already there are signs in the Field Marshal’s
household that new duties will soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
confront us. Some of the ladies are becoming
querulous. With ruffled feathers, they
scold the hours away. They even lose their
appetites and refuse to go outdoors. They
are watched, and many consultations held.
Some evening the great news comes. Already
a place has been prepared, and so
at dusk with lighted lantern three conspirators
creep abroad. Thirteen chosen eggs are
borne to a secluded retreat, and there we
find her, spread to an incredible breadth,
with head drawn in, beady eyes snapping,
and a vicious beak ready to strike if you
make an unguarded motion. The lantern is
held aloft and one by one the eggs are laid
before her. With gentle pressure she takes
them and stows them away in the recesses
of the feathers. Food and water are placed
near, and we tiptoe away, awed by this
mystery of life.</p>

<p>Tiny new abodes must be prepared, and
long hours are spent sitting in the sun,
mending, painting, renewing homes for the
expected offspring. What hours they are!
The talk is good: it ranges through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
heights and depths of life, its magic and its
mystery. Serious discussion of practical
details of construction follows close on the
heels of myth and fable. So the twenty-one
days pass. The last are feverish. It is hard
not to interfere, we feel that we could do so
much to help, but bitter experience has
taught us that the stupidest hen, even Mrs.
Cuttle, knows more about the matter in
hand than we do. We are humbled.</p>

<p>On the twenty-first day at twilight we
again seek her out. There she is, immovable,
spread deeper and wider than ever. Worn
with her long vigil, pale and wan, she resolutely
waits. Presently there is the faintest
shadow of a movement under the protecting
feathers. The watchers exchange excited
whispers; then slowly, one after the other,
we lean down and listen close to the maternal
breast. A feeble sound is heard, and
eyes are wide with wonder.</p>

<p>Then follow days of unremitting toil,
not unmixed with anxiety and cruel disappointments.
Tragedies come which spoil a
day for us, but it is part of the game, part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
of the great game we are trying to learn to
play with poise and patience.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I sit on the paddock fence and smoke my
pipe. I watch the sun sink low behind the
woodland to the west. Up from the ploughed
land comes the Field Marshal with his host.
When I first see him he has them in extended
order; as he comes to more difficult terrain,
he skillfully manœuvres them into a column
of fours and passes me in perfect array.
I drop to my feet and come to a rigid salute.
He passes the reviewing stand with glittering
eye and haughty step. I notice that on
the return into familiar country he is at the
head of the column. And what a picture he
makes! Here is a bird, methinks, who never
has had and never will have an “inferiority
complex.” And, after all, he is acting his
little part well. What more can man or bird
do? Play your part in the drama—and
what a drama it is!</p>

<p>Lights glimmer in the little house. I
must go. I thrust my pipe deep into my
pocket without knocking the heel out—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
habit I practise, but deplore; it has grown
on me of late years. I walk toward the
house. At the lilacs by the hedge I stop.</p>

<p>The soft air is full of myriads of little
voices; small rustling things disturb the
grass; the soft sod yields beneath my step,
and pungent odors float down the wind.
Life, imperious life is singing in the night
its message of growth. Grow and multiply,
grow, grow for to-morrow the harvest.
And the very stars in the heavens swing low
to listen.</p>

<p>A shrill cry of distress reaches my dreaming
ears. I start, but I know from whence it
comes. It is Mrs. Cuttle, late as usual,
blundering homeward in the dark.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">BLESSED BE THE COW</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I lay at full length on a shaded piazza
and pretended to read my excellent farm
paper. The midsummer heat made this
form of agriculture the only agreeable one.</p>

<p>“What,” asked my eldest, “is a bovine
ruminant in three letters?”</p>

<p>“A bovine ruminant,” I responded, “is
what the editor of this journal calls a cow.
The young gentlemen who edit a certain
literary weekly with which I was once
familiar would call a cow a bovine ruminant.
That is why I no longer take in the literary
weekly and continue to read the farm
journal.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” she said, “It fits nicely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“You are fortunate to find anything that
fits in this crazy world,” I answered, and
leaped to my feet.</p>

<p>I was in bad humor. Things were at
sixes and sevens, and besides, I had lost
my pipe. This was not an unusual event,
in fact, it is lost about half the time. But
for this happy circumstance I know I should
smoke too much.</p>

<p>I have an efficient friend, whose wife
keeps her kitchen spoons arranged on revolving
wooden cones, who suggested once
that a simple solution of my difficulty
would be to have two pipes. That is exactly
what an efficient man would suggest,
never stopping to consider the inconvenience
of having to hunt for two lost pipes.
One is bad enough.</p>

<p>I slouched into the garden and sat down
on a bench. It had been exposed to the sun
for some hours and was hot. I succeeded,
however, in locating my pipe in an entirely
improper and unorthodox pocket. I was
rather sorry I found it, for my tobacco was
moist and would not burn properly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>It soon became obvious that I could not
remain where I was. I rose and started on
an aimless round of my small estate. Never
had it looked worse; never was there plainer
evidence of a hundred sins of omission and
commission. I bit my pipestem savagely
as I passed the lilacs. Cerberus lay in a
cool hollow in the shade. He glanced up
at me and decided to remain where he was.
That hurt me, but I would not call him,
and I went on alone. The paddock was
empty. That was good—no place for a
horse in the boiling sun. I looked into the
stable. Everything was wrong, too many
stall windows closed; but I won’t open
them. On through the gate—open, of
course, in the face of definite orders to
keep it closed. I won’t close it, but I will
see about that later. I looked into the henhouse;
nothing but drooping birds in utter
dejection, save Mrs. Cuttle, who was rolling
in drunken ecstasy in a dust hole in
the yard.</p>

<p>I decided it was cooler in the house.
Perhaps if I laid some tobacco on a newspaper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
in the sun for a time things would
be better. I determined to try it.</p>

<p>As I approached I heard voices. There
were white-clad figures in the garden—the
dresses looked thin and cool. I caught
the sound of laughter, gentle and well-bred,
and the clink of ice in glass. For one moment
I stood irresolute, and then I fled.
Down past the strawberries I hurried. I
crouched behind the rose trellis, and made
the open. I did not want to run,—I
might be observed,—so I assumed an air
of importance and walked as rapidly as
possible over the rough ground. I climbed
the stone wall; a loose stone fell and
scraped my ankle. I said something and
hurried on. A great elm tree shades the
corner of this pasture; I sank to the ground
in sheer exhaustion beneath its extended
branches. Now I was safe.</p>

<p>I took off my coat and tried to put it between
my back and the tree. What a lot
of nonsense, I thought, is talked about
Mother Nature. I never lay on the ground
comfortably in my life; something always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
pricks or tickles or crawls, and it is hard.
Now a low chair in a shaded garden with a
cool drink in a tall glass, that might—but
no, I would rather lie here until numb
with stiffness than go back now.</p>

<p>Why people you don’t care about insist
on breaking into the privacy of people they
don’t care about is a mystery to me. This
whole fabric of social life is a tissue of pretense,
an empty trading in social coin: a
dinner for a dinner, a luncheon for a
luncheon, a call for a call, with a sweeping
clearance-sale once a year in the form of a
crowded miscellaneous affair called a tea.</p>

<p>Those people there in the garden. I do
not know who they are, but I can guess.
I am well out of it; I am sure I am not interested
in the domestic details of their lives,
and they are all talking at once about their
servants or their children. Unpleasant as my
present situation is, I am quite content to
stay here until they go and life returns to
the pleasant channels of normal privacy.</p>

<p>I tried sitting up straight; I even tried to
cross my legs, tailor-fashion—this proved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
an anatomical impossibility. I remembered
the tobacco, rose, and laid some out
on a stone near at hand. As I did so I
heard the swish of grass, and the family
cow moved placidly into the area of shade.
With delicate deliberation she lay down,
and we found ourselves face to face. If she
was surprised she did not betray it. She
looked at me with great liquid eyes as tranquil
as a forest pool. I noticed her nose.
How flat and big and wet and cool it
looked! I decided she was a good-looking
cow. I hope she is as good as she looks, for
she constitutes the entire herd.</p>

<p>I have a friend, a most engaging person,
who combines profound knowledge of a
dozen sciences with an encyclopædic erudition
in regard to cows. He asked me once
if she was a grade cow. I said I did not
know, but she had a curious metal tag in
one ear. He explained the significance of
the tag, and smiled. I like his smile—he
has wonderful teeth—poor fellow, he does
not smoke enough to ruin them.</p>

<p>There being nothing else to look at, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
looked at Dolly. She was chewing her cud.
The slow rhythmic precision of her technique
fascinated me. I particularly admired
the sideways movement of the lower jaw.
She stopped; a gentle genuflection of the
neck was noticeable; and she resumed. I
had never had such a chance to observe a
cow before and I made the most of it. I felt
that I was seeing for the first time the noble
dignity of her head, her broad fine brow, and
above all the eyes, serene and beautiful.</p>

<p>She was tormented by flies, but she
ignored them except for a lazy swish of
her tail. A distant train whistled; a car
screeched on the highway; she did not
move, but chewed serenely on.</p>

<p>I found it growing cooler; the tobacco
experiment was a success. I discovered an
agreeable hollow in the ground and fitted
myself comfortably into it.</p>

<p>I recalled those far-off bitter days when
I did not own a cow, when her only substitute
was the rattle of bottles in an alley
at some grim hour before dawn. What
fiendish delight the purveyor of those bottles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
took in banging area gates! I have never
known any early-morning milkmen intimately,
but I have often wondered what
their private lives might be. I suppose
they enjoy the rights of citizenship—they
may have homes—I wonder.</p>

<p>Then I looked at Dolly’s eyes again. I
could not resist them. I recalled the age-old
story of the maiden changed to a
heifer by a jealous god. I noticed for the
first time a look of imprisoned sadness in
her eyes. There was a gadfly in that story
too, I remembered, and it drove her into the
sea. Unlike mortals, Dolly has evidently
developed an immunity to gadflies.</p>

<p>What wonderful old stories those are!
How young the world was, and how it has
changed! All but Dolly; she is as she was,
grazing on the slopes of Olympus. It is
man who has hurried and worried himself
from change to change until he can no
longer see the beauty of the simple, lovely,
unchanged thing.</p>

<p>How cool the breeze, how sweet the odor
of the grass! The restless spring has passed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
The year has grown; and now the full accomplishment
of summer meets the eye.
The season pauses, and for a few matchless
weeks we see no change. Nature rests;
her work is well-nigh done, and you are
free to see it all if you will only look.</p>

<p>Dolly rose to her feet and turned slowly
toward the bars. No need to clang the
hour in jangling notes from tawdry towers;
Dolly has met the tryst at the meadow
gate ever since Pan piped the shepherd’s
flocks to madness. I rose too, and we went
together to the gate. I let down the bars
and we stepped through. She stopped to
crop a tuft of grass. I slid my arm over her
neck, and through the meadow where I fled
in haste we walked side by side with measured
tread toward the sweet-smelling barn.</p>

<p>The demands of my small estate are
modest, but I employ the services of one
associate and fellow worker. He must be a
man of varied talents and tireless industry
and above all, for my entire satisfaction, he
must be gifted with a sense of values, a feeling
for the fitness of things. This is hard to find.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>I hate to make a change, but occasionally
it has to be done, and that involves the ordeal
of interviewing applicants, a duty I
loathe and perform badly. The interview
always changes from an inquiry into the
applicant’s fitness for the place into a
lengthy apology on my part for the duties
imposed. I have the courage, however, to
make my decision hang on his answers to
two questions. When last struggling with
this problem I was called upon by a brisk
young man who impressed me tremendously.
He seemed the sort of person who would
romp through his day’s work by noon and
have the rest of the time to devote to the
small details never attended to properly
with me. I had made up my mind to entrust
myself to his masterful direction. I
paused before applying the final test; I
eyed him narrowly.</p>

<p>“Do you milk?” I asked.</p>

<p>A deprecatory smile flittered across his
face; that was all. The question was too
absurd to require a verbal answer.</p>

<p>“Do you milk—reverently?” I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>“In my last place,” he answered, “we
milked by electricity.”</p>

<p>I dismissed him. What a preposterous
idea! I would as soon cultivate my roses
with a caterpillar tractor.</p>

<p>The next applicant was an inefficient-looking
elderly man with kind eyes. He
had nice wrinkles. I count a great deal on
wrinkles.</p>

<p>I asked him the crucial question. For
one moment he searched my very soul
with twinkling eyes.</p>

<p>“I try to,” he said.</p>

<p>And so the Incomparable One came.</p>

<p>As Dolly and I pass the rose trellis behind
which I had skulked an hour before,
I square my shoulders and walk upright
like a man. Here Cerberus joins us. He
rubs a cool, moist nose in the palm of my
hand and trots quietly beside me.</p>

<p>Two khaki-clad little figures appear from
the house, carrying between them a glittering
pail. The Incomparable One springs
from the earth somewhere, and we all meet
on the gravel path before the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>The Incomparable One, with a broken
riding-crop as his badge and insignia of
rank, takes my place and gently directs
Dolly’s progress. We fall behind and wait
outside till Dolly has drunk her fill and is
standing in her accustomed place. Once,
pail in hand, I had preceded her, but my
error had been made plain to me, and I
never transgressed again.</p>

<p>Dolly now in place, the Incomparable
One returns. With hands and arms glistening
from recent soapy ablutions, he takes
the pail and holds it to the sun. He examines
every inch of it critically and with
deliberate care. The process is always observed
by an Hibernian lady from a kitchen
window with whole-hearted disapproval.
This daily episode is the only incident in a
busy life in which my perfect servitor is
not the very flower of tact and discretion.</p>

<p>His examination complete, we go where
Dolly waits. He takes his place on gently
tilted stool; we stand one side. He pulls
his rolled-back sleeves an inch higher, his
great firm hands are rubbed together, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
then the fingers flex in smooth preparatory
exercises. He leans forward and gently
touches each teat in turn. From each he
pulls a tiny lactic stream and lets it fall
upon the clean rye straw beneath his feet.
This is not done because—as held by
some—the first milk contains more impurities
than the rest; it is a libation, a
propitiatory offering to whatever god there
be who presides over the destinies of cattle
and impecunious rural sentimentalists.</p>

<p>And now an upward glance. A little
figure, each in daily turn, takes its place,
and Dolly’s swinging tail is gently held at
rest. The pail is raised to its position between
extended knees, and all is ready. I
notice that the milker adheres to the proper
school. I do not hold, myself, for a position
with the forehead of the milker pressed
against the bovine flank; rather, I like to
see the left knee gently touching the off
hind leg. It is a satisfaction to see things
done with a nice attention to detail.</p>

<p>And now we hear the first streams strike
the bottom of the empty pail. The shrill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
staccato of their impact is the overture,
soon muffled by the increasing flood. The
cadence slows; we are in the full orchestral
swing by now. The milker’s bowed head is
slowly raised, and, as the white foam nears
the top, he looks aloft. He sways a bit on
his tilted stool; his head moves gently back
and forth like some inspired conductor
carrying his musicians through the difficult
passages of a mighty symphony. And
now the beat quickens, the little streams
leap into the rising tide of foam with soft
lisping sounds. A final volley; then a few
soft notes, long-drawn, and it is done.</p>

<p>The milker rises, flushed, triumphant. He
casts a quick appraising glance at the pail.</p>

<p>“Half quart off to-night—the grass is
getting dry,” he says.</p>

<p>Our messengers wait, and with the heavy
pail between, carry our precious spoil kitchenward.
Once, when the going was slippery,
an accident occurred. But that is not
spoken of now.</p>

<p>I glance about the tidy stable. How well
he keeps it! Windows closed against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
noonday heat now open to cooling breezes
of late afternoon. The little gate to the
back land, swung hospitably open, invites
me to explore its familiar mysteries. I
visit the pigs and have a cheerful moment
as I note that even here are care and cleanliness.
The henhouse, freshly whitewashed,
smells of lime, and sleek fat fowl are busy
with fresh litter on a dry, clean floor.
Cerberus is at my side; my pipe draws cool
and sweet.</p>

<p>I remember the garden and the white-clad
guests. I shake what dust I may from
coat and trousers—I find the guests have
lingered. The garden lies half shadowed;
sweet flowering things in gay profusion line
the soft green turf; a bluebird glides from
treetop to tiny pool to drink and bathe.</p>

<p>Gracious ladies sit in gentle talk beneath
the trees. I join them. I note with satisfaction
that the group contains none save
the choice elect. They know the easy give-and-take
of talk. They have a feeling for
silence, the one true test of gentle breeding.
Their clothes, a mystery beyond my ken,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
are those I like—sheer, simple things with
graceful lines; their hands, the firm, strong
hands of ripened womanhood, with scant
adornment. Tiny feet, well shod, are—like
their hands—at rest. These four who
so adorn the scene are the only ones I know
who can sit still.</p>

<p>We talk, each as we choose: the homely
task, the book, the play, the careless unthought
talk of friends. I feel an utter
thankfulness: my lines in very truth have
fallen in the pleasantest of places. And
well may I be thankful, for many moons
may wax and wane before this group, by
happy accident, shall meet again in perfect
mood and perfect weather. And to think
I almost missed it! What brought me back?
What happened over yonder, ’neath the
tree where Dolly grazed?</p>

<p>The shadows lengthen. One by one, with
laughing eyes, the guests betake themselves
to homes made blessed by their presence.
And now we sit in silence. Back from
duties well performed, the children come.
Tired little bodies seek the softness of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
close-cropped grass. Cerberus sees that all
is well, and sinks to slumber by my chair.</p>

<p>Peace, perfect peace, comes with the
setting sun.</p>

<p>The evening meal is ready. Grudgingly
we leave the glamour of the hour. As we
cross the grass, a voice says, “I am glad
you joined us. It was pleasant.”</p>

<p>And as I stop to fondle Cerberus at the
door I think I hear—I am not sure—the
same voice saying, in a soft aside, “So,
blessed be the cow.”</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent">BLESSED BE THE HORSE</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I live in a hunting-country. Every autumn
our stone walls show tiny red banners
marking the run, and the talk is much
of horse.</p>

<p>I do not hunt, myself: my interest in the
sport is purely academic. But of one thing
I am sure—from an æsthetic standpoint
there is no sport like it.</p>

<p>On occasions the run passes within sight
of my abode, and sometimes it begins or ends
within a stone’s throw of my outdoor bedroom.
Those are the rare mornings. No
need to watch the clock. You lie secure and
warm, half sleeping, half awake, when slowly
you hear far off that magic sound of beating
hoofs—not the sharp rattle of steel on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
harsh macadam, but the low beat of distant
hoofs on good firm earth. There is no sound
like it. You catch a suggestion of it sometimes
when you ride alone, and horse and
rider share the glory of a run across some
open meadow before you turn for the long,
cool walk homeward with loose rein and
lowered head. But to hear it in its perfection
scores of hoofs must beat in unison, and
it must begin far off and come on toward
you with growing intensity.</p>

<p>I hear it and sit up. I pull the blankets
close. It is frosty. Stray wisps of mist still
lie in the hollows. From chaste retirement
I can view the whole panorama. The
hounds swing round the corner of the woods,
tiny specks of brown-and-white in full cry,
followed close by splashes of scarlet. On
they come, they take each intervening wall
smoothly and without effort. The field follows,
strung out in orderly observance of the
rules and courtesies, whatever they may be,
of this regal game. And all the time the
music of the hoofs swells about me, teases,
tempts, and troubles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>The pack stops by the elm tree in Dolly’s
pasture. A grizzled rider yaps his immemorial
call, as old as hunting, as ancient as this
noble sport itself. He tosses tidbits to the
eager pack: their scant reward for miles of
breathless coursing, unless the run itself be
their reward. The old man has ridden many
times like this; he knows the best there is to
show. I wonder sometimes how he thinks
we do at this old sport in this new country,
for he has ridden with the best across the
seas. I watched the hounds as they swept in
and knew he must be pleased, for close-packed
they came, as if they would make
good his boast that one horse-blanket could
cover them—the final and unfailing test.
The field is in. The Master, magnificent in
scarlet, sitting a fretful horse with smiling
composure, greets them all, a friendly word
and kindly smile for stragglers coming in a
bit abashed. The steaming horses move in
easy circles, while grooms attend the more
exalted riders.</p>

<p>They take the highway and in laughing
groups go down the road. A boy appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
and plucks the red pennants from the walls.
It is done.</p>

<p>I nestle down. Once more my eyes have
seen the glory of the field. I am content,
and doze once more, and once again I feel
unbounded admiration for the men and
women who can so disport themselves
before they break their fast.</p>

<p>At an appropriate and fitting hour I repair
to my own stable. I do this with some
hesitation, for on these mornings, when the
hunting-world has swung into our orbit, the
Incomparable One greets me with a manner
somewhat vague and questioning. He is not
quite sure of me and not convinced that his
own status is just what he would wish it to
be. Why I am not afield he does not know;
a horrid doubt assails him. On these mornings
I tread with circumspection the devious
paths of horsy talk.</p>

<p>Even in my little stable there is a strange
unrest. Eyes are brighter; ears are up;
nervous hoofs are pawing.</p>

<p>I look them all over; first my own (of
course, no man may talk of what is “his”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
with any truth), one in a thousand, purchased
for a song, as is my wont by stern
necessity, rescued from menial labor and
now pet and darling of us all, perhaps a bit
too much horse for me, but kind and willing,
wise and spirited. The other two, black
ponies with white stars, as like as sisters
save that one has two white feet and one has
one. Each owns a little mistress whom she
loves, and these two ponies are as like their
riders as if all four were sisters—one nervous,
one sedate; one eager at the bit and
to be handled with a steady hand, the other
willing, always in the van, but temperate
and steady. Just a word, and she is back in
hand. One curb, one snaffle, so it goes. But
use them both aright and all is well.</p>

<p>There are two pleasures in this horse-relation,
one afield and one here in the stable.
To-day it is indoors, for the promise of the
morning has failed. Already a gentle rain is
falling and the woods are wet. I love to potter
about a stable. A clean stable is the
nicest-smelling place in the world. Why
feminine nostrils object to stable smells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
indoors I never could understand; but that
is only one small part of a greater riddle.</p>

<p>The Incomparable One has learned to
know my oddities. One of them is an unreasonable
passion for soft leather and glittering
metal. What lovelier thing can
mortal hand touch than leather, smooth and
clean, as soft and supple as velvet? The
trappings of my steeds are meagre and far
from the best. I see that all is safe, no
weak spots at buckles and other secret
places; but once safe, that is as far as I can
go, except that I believe and teach the
simple theory that the poorer the tack the
greater the care. And the Incomparable
One does wonders. The bridles hang against
a clean white cloth; the brow-bands in perfect
alignment; the curb against the wall;
the snaffle broken, lying on the curb; the
chain over the snaffle; reins looped high in
perfect symmetry. There is a sight to
please: the saddles on their racks with irons
off, smooth, clean, and soft; no dust, no
soap in crevices, betray an artist’s hand.
The irons hang on cleaning-hooks and wait<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
a final polishing. The feed room next, with
its supplies. And now aloft to where the
sweet hay lies in dusty half-lights. What a
place to dream an hour away, and what a
play-place for little people, their minds afire
with all the mystery and romance of their
first young years!</p>

<p>And now it rains in earnest. I find a small
green stool; I take it to the door and sit me
down. An open stable-door, a windless rain,
a dog beside you, and a bedraggled hen or
two to scratch outside. This is the perfect
place to be. The moist, damp odors all
about you, the sound of restless hoofs,
the grind of teeth on hay, the dropping
water from the eaves fill ears and heart
and soul.</p>

<p>What a strange thing it is that a certain
type of biped called Man should have chance
dominion over all the other creatures! How
he has bound them to his service! And of
them all no one has suffered as the horse.</p>

<p>He seems more sensitive than the others.
No horse has bad habits, save man-taught
ones. What a score on some far-off Judgment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Day has the horse to settle with his
master, man! And that is why I like to fuss
with horses. I like to try to show them that
this relationship can be agreeable to us both.
I have no feeling for an outlaw horse, but
any horse that has not had unfortunate
human relationships too long is worth the
experiment.</p>

<p>The horse is a habit-making, habit-controlled
creature. The trick seems to be,
so far as my very meagre experience has
shown, to teach good habits. And of all the
creatures I know man is in some ways the
least fitted to teach them. He is vain, imperious,
and often cowardly; that is why a perfect
horseman is just a bit more rare than
a perfect poet. I have long since given over
any ambition to write an epic poem, but
I do hope, if life be spared, by patience,
humility, and the sternest application to
the task, to learn to ride a horse. I doubt
my ultimate success, but somehow I feel
that if I ever do, in the face of almost insuperable
obstacles both physical and mental,
it will be a splendid achievement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>The golden autumn days go by and the
first suggestion of real winter comes. We
have, however, here and there a day dedicated
to the horse.</p>

<p>Such a day dawns. It is the day that with
us is devoted, in theory, to the memory of
a Genoese sailor, and is made by beneficent
legislation a holiday, a day free from the
thralldom of office and school! It has been
decided that the morning shall be spent in
tasks; there shall be an early lunch, and
then a ride, timed to bring us back through
the woods when the sun is low and streams
in level golden shafts between the trees.</p>

<p>I seek the stable. Already preparations
are afoot. My garb alone is warrant for the
news. I watch the horses cleaned. I never
watch a workman without a thrill, if only
he be a real craftsman, a man who loves his
work. And such a one is he who cleans my
horses. I can clean a horse after a fashion,
but here is consummate art: free swing of
comb and brush following the graceful lines
of the creature’s body; the softly spoken
word to soothe impatience; the low soft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
whistling sound that none but the elect can
manage; the tap of comb on hoof or floor;
the fearless, accustomed handling of a horse.
A perfect art, and loved, I know, by horse as
well as man. What little skill I have in other
things I’d gladly trade if I could clean a
horse the way this old man does.</p>

<p>The hours lag, but now we meet for lunch.
Plans are discussed, our course laid out.
We make the meal a mockery and hurry to
the stable. No having horses brought round
to the door—not in our simple life are
things like that. We seek them out, and
make the pleasure greater.</p>

<p>They stand in single file upon the floor,
saddled and bridled, waiting our command.
Each is covered with a bright plaid cooler;
ears are erect, and nervous lips jingle the
shining bits.</p>

<p>The Incomparable One is as busily important
as if each steed were a prospective
Derby winner. We pull off the coolers, each
our own. We fold them up and hang them
on the rail, and then we drop restraining
hitching-ropes and go out single file. No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
mounting on a slippery stable floor; we
want good gravel, smoothly packed beneath
our feet. And then I watch to see if lessons
have been learned: three things to do before
you mount. I smile at the Incomparable
One, and he smiles too, as little hands seek
saddle girths. A gentle tug; they are all
right, not loose, not tight. Then the throatlatch:
it must rest light and easy. Then the
curb, to see if it be smooth. All is reported
right, so then we mount. We feel again a
moving creature under us; we feel the gentle
lift of smooth, straight legs, and we are off.</p>

<p>I take my place with Two Feet on my
right. I notice two links are dropped on
her curb chain—it is well. One Foot sedately
takes her place upon my left; her
curb swings loose; no need for a free hand
on that side.</p>

<p>We cross the first meadow at a walk.
Two Feet capers and frets a bit; she has not
learned yet what One Foot knows so well,
that we walk this meadow to test the tack,
to feel the seat we have, to find the irons, and
to learn the mood that horse and rider share<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
to-day. We turn into the next; and now a
word, and heads come up and off we trot.
A gentle pace, but still enough to bring the
breeze to our faces, and now we hear the
hoofs, the soft sound of yielding leather,
and the click of steel. I look from right to
left. Youth still fretful and impatient on my
right, so I suggest a little lighter hand, a
soothing word; upon the left, Experience
trots with even temper and with steady
stride.</p>

<p>Before us lies a smooth, ascending swell.
I ask if we are ready, irons back, feet forward.
Then a gentle pressure of the heel, a
rein drawn lightly, and three creatures leap.
Youth takes the lead; a word must bring
her back. This is no race or steeplechase.
So back she comes, but shakes her head and
dashes foam upon her shoulder. Experience
travels neck and neck with me, a tranquil
eye, but nostrils quiver, and I wonder if she
is recalling days when this pace was mere
play for her. At the brow of the hill we pull
up and loosen rein. Three heads go down a
bit; we ease our seats, and I can see the glow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
in cheeks and eyes that must mean joy and
health in future years.</p>

<p>And now a long walk to the woods. We
talk of hands and knees, of heels, and of our
mounts, each feeling that we ride the very
best. And so it goes, walk, trot, and canter.
Yes, my friend, that’s all. I know it all
seems tame to you. We hack, I know, but
hacking at its best is all we ever hope or
want to do. It is enough. It takes us out; it
gives us joy to feel that we can do that
much, and day by day we hope to do it
better.</p>

<p>And now we reach the woods. The sun is
right. We go in single file, with Experience
ahead to show the way, and Youth comes
next, and Age brings up the rear.</p>

<p>I look ahead at those two little figures.
They are learning the hard lessons: constant
care, constant thought, the hands, the knee,
how often do I speak the word! How hard
they try, and how fast they learn! I sometimes
think it arrogant to teach; they do as
well as I, and better too at times. But now
no lessons for the woods entrance. Dry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
leaves are on the path and squirrels scold
and scurry. We shout back and forth, “Oh,
look! See this, and that!” And then a new
tremendous enterprise portends; a strange,
new path leads—none of us knows where.
We take it, and we wind and twist. What
glorious fun, what adventure! and we shout
with glee when it brings us out in well-known
pastures far from home.</p>

<p>We turn across the broad acres of a
friendly neighbor; a narrow, shaded lane
invites. A stern sign posted at the gate
warns all away, but we are of the elect and
enter in. We are under the pine trees now;
the needles pave the path. Oh, what a footing!
Once more we trot, and almost without
sound of hoof we whirl along. Youth is
calmer now; she works with us; she has
learned the pace and keeps her stride unbroken.
Experience asks for more bridle;
she knows where she is, and wants a freer
head on the long upgrade that brings us to
my neighbor’s house.</p>

<p>He sees us and waves his hand. He sits in
a great chair upon his lawn. A perfect horseman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
he will never ride again, but it is joy
to him to see the children come, for to such
as they he must pass the torch of gentle
sportsmanship. And now the crowning
moment comes. We swing into a great field,
again my kindly neighbor’s, and questioning
eyes are turned to mine.</p>

<p>All right, we will—but careful now! I
know the ground, it’s smooth, without a
hole, and yonder is a tiny jump, put there
by kindly thought for children. I show the
way, and as I turn to watch the others,
Experience follows; her stride is easy, every
nerve at rest. She takes the tiny jump as
part of her day’s work and canters up and
stops. Youth now comes, pulling just a bit
and nervous in her stride. She takes it well,
but jumps a foot too high and does not want
to stop when she is over. She will learn;
when she has learned she will know that half
the work will do it just as well.</p>

<p>And now the end. We whirl. We let them
go. For one short moment we thunder side
by side. We hear the hoofs; we feel the
plunging bodies between our knees; we see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
the foam blown in the wind. The earth
glides under us; we seem to fly. How sure
the feet, how mighty are the muscles that
hurl us forward! And how our hearts beat
and how our faces tingle!</p>

<p>Now we turn toward home. Cool horses
out, cool horses in, is our rule. We walk side
by side and talk of our adventures. We tell
where we were right and where we blundered;
how wonderful the horses were; of
the beautiful things we saw; of our friends
who let us ride over their good land; how to
do this and when to do that; all the wonderful
minutiæ of the greatest sport in the
world. We turn down our little avenue;
we come home formally and in order.</p>

<p>The Incomparable One is waiting. We
dismount, and he takes my horse, out of
deference to age and general incapacity.
My comrades take charge of their own. We
have learned it all—how saddles come off
and what you do with them; how bridles
come off and where to put them; what to
do with the horses and why. What a world
of fun it is! The sugar is brought, and glistening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
necks arch and gentle lips fondle the
sweet offering lying in the flat palms of little
hands. And then to the house, to talk it all
over again with the world’s most attentive
listener.</p>

<p>When bedtime comes, I see a light in
the stable and go down to find the Incomparable
One in the tiny saddle-room.</p>

<p>Somehow that last gallop has made me
feel a bit more his peer. So the talk is
once more easy, and for an hour it runs.
Shrewd, kindly, brave the old man is, and
somehow I feel that his body has been kept
young and strong, his soul serene and sweet,
by his simple, whole-hearted love of horse.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">BLESSED BE THE GARDEN</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I had as soon read fairy stories to my children
in the Congressional Library as to
walk in some of the gardens I have seen. For
me a garden should be part of one’s abode,
simply another room to step into when the
mood requires, a place for early morning
investigation and for evening solitude. And
such a garden is mine. Why gardens should
be made solely a place of exhibition, why
they should be tortured into tedious formality
and used only on social occasions, is a
mystery to me.</p>

<p>Like a good many other things, the use
made of gardens by their owners depends a
great deal on the owner’s attitude toward
gardens in general.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>I am familiar with two; one the grand
manner, which dismisses all details to underlings
and which accepts the garden simply
as a useful decorative accessory of a highly
ornamental life. This manner, for the most
obvious of reasons, is not mine. Nor do I
accept the over-intimate and prying fussiness
of some garden owners: those good people
who tell you they know every plant
and every flower, who dilate on the doubtful
pleasure of doing all the work themselves,
who brazenly acclaim the fact that the
garden has no secrets from them.</p>

<p>I feel like saying to them: “Dear sir, or
madam, what is—what can be your idea
of a garden? Is it a laboratory? Is it a workshop?
Is it a public house? Do you not
know that a becoming reticence is Nature’s
greatest charm? She does not want you
prying about with your little shovel; she
knows what she is doing. Your relation
with your garden is quite different from that
with your iceman. It is wise to know as
much as you can about your iceman, but do
leave your garden in peace. Beside, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
are in a fair way to lose all that is best in
having a garden, if you have not done so
already.”</p>

<p>I feel toward a garden a good deal as I do
toward a beautiful woman: I do not want
to know how she gets her effects.</p>

<p>My feeling about garden work is quite
different from my feeling about any other
work I do on my small place. I love to slave
in a stable or henhouse, for there must be
no secrets in either, but I find that great
discretion must be used in my work in my
garden.</p>

<p>It is only fair to say that, anatomically,
I am singularly unfitted for much of the
work required. It is a long way to the
ground, and to work doubled over, with
my head between my knees, I find both
tedious and unprofitable. But quite apart
from this there are many cogent reasons for
my dislike of this kind of work. I know
people who delight in visiting a hotel
kitchen, that they may see their feast in
preparation. I regard this as little short of
sacrilege. A perfect meal is a work of art,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
and why they should want to witness the
sordid details of its preparation is a wonder
to me. So it is, or should be, with a garden.
The perfect product should be accepted in
its perfection, without too much inquiry
into or participation in its early stages.</p>

<p>So I delegate as much of this work as I
can to hands more competent than mine,
contenting myself with tentative suggestion
and occasional oversight. The man-made
and man-arranged part of a garden interests
me but little; it is when Nature takes command,
and, left to herself, begins to work
her miracles that the beauty and the mystery
of the garden call me to wonder and to
worship.</p>

<p>Certain chosen tasks are my delight. An
entirely unsystematic and listless weeding
is one of them, though I confess that the
uprooting of any growing thing always
brings a pang of doubt to my mind. Often
have I nurtured some alien plant and allowed
it to flourish because I could not bring
myself to tear it up, and passed anxious days
lest it be discovered by those in authority.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
I like to take under my charge those plants
that do not flourish, for I know it is man’s
stupidity that makes them backward—some
defect in their environment or arrangement.
I try to solve the riddle, and sometimes
I succeed. Some corner, some spot ill
favored by sun or soil, fails to provide a
living for anything put there; what delight
to learn the secret, correct the error, and
produce strong growth and hardy blossoms!</p>

<p>But my chief delight is to sally forth with
shears, twine, and a sheaf of slender green
sticks, and search out friends in need of
succor.</p>

<p>To such as these I explain my errand.
Even in my little garden, so “informal” as
to be almost slovenly, I know that many
cruelties are done: plants of varying and
hostile habit thrown together, all living, like
myself, under unnatural and often abhorred
conditions, trying with all the strength that
is in them to escape, to assert themselves,
to be as Nature meant them to be. These
I try to restrain gently and to correct their
wayward tendencies. Often I find some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
plant that for countless generations has
known but one habit of growth. Suddenly
confronted by abnormal conditions and unfamiliar
restraints, it throws tradition to
the winds and develops new and strange
habits, changes its appearance, and becomes
a wanton thing. Such as these I try to restore—with
many misgivings—to a more
conventional manner of life.</p>

<p>There are those who, like children, are
outgrowing their strength, and so I place
the needed support and gently tie them to it,
explaining, as to children, that it is but for
a time, that the bonds are soft, and that as
soon as the fibre toughens in their little
minds and bodies it will be removed.</p>

<p>Then the cutting and pruning—there
is sheer delight. Is it a spark of some old
savage forbear that has given man his desire
to kill, or is it merely man’s inherent vanity?
I stand before the tiny bush, with flashing
steel in hand. The cave man growls; his
fingers itch to cut, to slash, to sever. The
coxcomb struts and simpers; he wants the
plant to bow before him or be slain; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
wishes it to feel that only by the grace of
this most graceless creature may it live. I
know not which it be, perhaps a bit of both.
Cut I do, but always with restraint, without
the cruel pleasure of the brute; and in humility
I strive to check my vanity of being by
some mystery lord of this domain.</p>

<p>And when the heat of summer comes,
when cruel thirst is drying leaf and bud,
there comes a twilight hour when hose is
brought and tiny pots are filled and full
libations poured. Then later in the darkness
you may walk and smell once more
the odor of damp earth, and you can really
hear the little thankful noises of the plants.</p>

<p>These are some of the pleasures that I
know, but over all, supreme and final, is
the kinship that you feel for every growing
thing. To have this in the full, again I say:
be wary of too intimate a view. You do
not pry into the secrets of your friends; you
do not care to know the hidden things that
make them what they are. If you are wise
you let your children have some little
chambers in their minds close-locked against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
intrusion, where the strange alchemy of life
works out its mysteries.</p>

<p>So with my garden. There are many
dark and shady little places where I do not
pry, for here the sacred things are hid that
I shall know in their fruition. If with a
vulgar curiosity I poke about, expose them
to the sun, and break the spell, I frustrate
all the plans so quietly afoot. I watch it
all and make my guess. I peep a little here
and there, and smile when small reward
results. I am quick to act when danger
comes, but slow to bother when life runs
in even tenor, and I try to coax my little
garden to confide.</p>

<p>And when it once begins to tell its secrets
to me, then no swain who wins at last his
loved one’s confidence is more elate.</p>

<p>The early morning is the best. Not too
early. I do not hold with those who, with
the lark, attempt to catch a garden unawares.
In decency, I mean, when all is
ready, when the sweet languor of the night
is past, but long before the business of the
day has come—that is the time. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
silver dewy webs are on the grass, when
flower cups adroop are full, and leaves are
damp. If you look close you’ll see a
thousand secret things, exposed at night,
not yet secluded from the sun. This and
the evening hour are those of confidence.</p>

<p>All day the business of the little world
goes on: the task of growth, of flowering
and seed, the scented traffic of the toiling
bee, the visits of the birds, the errands of
the breeze, make for a busy time with little
chance for secret enterprise. No man-made
factory can compare with this in perfect
unison, in calm control and harmony in
work. I wish that every mortal who controls
his fellows in their toil might have a
garden to consult in time of strife, for if he
did the strife would never be.</p>

<p>My right to have a garden is often
tacitly questioned by those whose garden
technique differs from mine. They may be
right; I hold no brief for my unlettered
manner. I am not wise; I do not know a
thousand useful things; I try in vain to
store my mind with countless facts that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
would enable me to hold my place in
learned talk with experts at the game. But
it is vain; I fail, as I have always failed, to
know the niceties of any craft. I read and
marvel that a mortal mind can compass all
I find in garden books. I love to read them,
for I feel a little sense of fellowship with
those whose lore I envy, and I know they
add new members to a goodly fellowship;
but to claim I understand it all is vanity.
The names alone! The strange and awful
appellations which they give my homely
friends! With what accustomed grace they
handle them! I marvel at their erudition,
and despair.</p>

<p>My own nomenclature is strange and
weird. It serves my purpose, for I never
try to talk of plants except between ourselves,
and kindly members of my family
condone my strange stupidity. Colors aid,
and so does height of growth. What more
convenient method could you ask? The tall
white thing, the low one also white, the tall
pink thing, its lower mate beyond—what
could be better? And when we barter for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
new seeds or plants I leave all that to those
who know the names which nurserymen
and seedsmen use to dignify their wares.
Then, too, the habit of the things assists:
the happy and the sulky ones, the proud,
the modest, timid, or abashed. How plainly
every one will give you clue to name it by.
Of course, a few good names remain all
twisted up with childhood’s memories of
other gardens, other kindly folk, who taught
them to us when we first became aware
that gardens are, alone, the places on this
earth most worth the space they occupy.</p>

<p>A garden must have privacy—a wall, a
hedge, something to keep the world away,
for here the choicest hours will be spent.
It must have shade, for here will come repose
for mind and body more serene than
can be found elsewhere. It should be small
or have a part reserved for fellowship with
growing things. There must be seats, not
horrid wooden things upon which no one
in his normal mind would sit. For pure
effect against a wall of green they satisfy,
but as a place to rest, a mockery and sham.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
Give me low seats with ample room for elbows
and for legs, so low your hand may
touch the grass, that matches may be
thrust into the ground and not thrown
heedlessly about. These are the only trappings
that you need, save pool or basin for
the birds to bathe.</p>

<p>Of course, man starts no enterprise, no
undertaking for his betterment, without attack
from myriads of foes. Just why this
should be so, I do not know. Perhaps his
ignorance is cause; perhaps he counts as
foes a thousand things that help him though
he know it not. But certainly it seems ordained
that garden joys should pay the
highest toll in watchfulness and toil. Why
cannot things be beautiful without a battle
for the right to live? Perhaps it is that
pleasures lightly won are lightly held. If
this be so, then any garden which has won
its way should give its owner deepest
gratitude.</p>

<p>For every year new pestilence arrives,
new swarms of insects bringing blight and
death must be combated. Why should this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
be? Has not man suffered now enough to
recompense that incident of long ago in the
first garden that the new world knew?
Why may we not contrive to make a place
secure from harm, safe from some flying
menace to all growth? Is it all wrong that
we should thus attempt to fashion something
sweet and pure and good? Or do
we fly into the face of laws unknown to
us, which, after all, are wise, if we but
knew?</p>

<p>I do not know; but while the breath of
life is in me, while eye can see and hand
can serve my will, I’ll fight these creatures
with relentless fury, that I may have a tiny
spot, one little haven, one small safe retreat
where beauty, peace, and quiet may
be found.</p>

<p>My enmity does not extend beyond the
insect brood. I feel quite differently about
the impertinences of my little fur-bearing
marauders. There wits are matched and
cunning is displayed. The sluggish woodchuck
is a friend of mine, and rabbits have
a quaint bucolic flavor. A flash of cottontail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
amid the pea-brush is a pretty sight. Well
may I feel a tolerance for rabbits, for
they comprise one of the busiest departments
of our establishment. These gentle,
mild-eyed creatures make ideal pets for
children. Their care teaches lessons of gentleness
and foresight. Their wants are few,
and great the joy they give. Our own started
with a single pair, but, as time went on, we
found ourselves embarrassed by a constantly
increasing company. The great problem at
first was security, but soon we fashioned an
abode proof from attack by day or night,
and so they lived content. At first our colony
could be kept down to reasonable proportions
by gifts to unsuspecting friends,
but soon that outlet failed, and now we are
in a fair way to be overwhelmed. Once in a
while, by some unforeseen event a wholesale
jail-delivery occurs, and countless rabbits
swarm the place. I prayerfully hope that
many may seek asylum in adjacent woods
and not return, but by far the greater part
come back, not having found the wild
places to their taste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>It is during these periods that my garden
suffers and my always doubtful popularity
with my neighbors sinks to its lowest ebb.
So when a flash of white, a pair of ears dart
through my garden I content myself with
shouts and harmless missiles badly thrown,
for how can I tell that this tiny intruder
is not some vagrant member of my own
increasing flock?</p>

<p>There is one friend I have who seems to
be part of my garden. He is a fellow worker
too, a creature of rare tact, who calls but
seldom. When in the twilight I catch sight
of his squat black figure on the garden path
I know my ally is afield. He seems a lonely
soul, but quite content.</p>

<p>I wonder what the far-off recollections are
that come to me when I behold a toad: faint
pixy notions, sprites, hobgoblins and their
ilk, and jewels too, a medley from the past.
Why this small spot of black on business
bent should send me off to fairyland, I do
not know. But when the toad is near I
always feel that fairy creatures are about
me too. So, if I’m not observed, I fall into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
a habit that besets and hold strange converse
with him. And I hear of grottos far
and damp, where jewels are in heaps my
shoulder high. A princess lies in durance
vile guarded by shapeless oafs. He tells of
mountain fastnesses where caldrons simmer
and old witches croon, of tiny chargers with
small knights a-mount, of glittering plumes,
of rapiers and shields, of gallant deeds, of
breathless chase, of song, of dance, of strange
small lights that flicker on the moor. It is
my fancy that he knows of these. And this
is what a garden does to me; this small soft
creature, only out for food, becomes a
fabled creature of romance, and surely if in
days like these a toad can strike the shackles
from your mind and let you be a child
in every thought, a toad is well worth
while.</p>

<p>He hops away and leaves me desolate.
A tinkle sounds within the little house. I
answer it. “Yes, yes. I know that matter
of the school. O, Lord! I never go to meetings.
But my vote? Oh, yes, I’ll come, but
make it brief.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>As I ring off I’m asked, “Whom were you
talking with just now out in the garden?”</p>

<p>“A friend,” I say, “who called to bring
me news.”</p>

<p>“I hope it was not some stray dog. The
garden suffers from too many friends.”</p>

<p>I know that she is right. I must be stricter
with these trespassers, all save the toad who
toils for me.</p>

<p>But the fact is, I cannot find it in my
heart to dispute possession of this fair spot
with any fellow creature, especially with
those little wild folk whose right is vastly
better than my own. No paltry written
deed, doubtless defective in essential details,
vouches for their occupancy, but rather long
inheritance and straight descent from the
first owners. A soft and inefficient point of
view, I know. It wins scant approval from
my friend who styles himself a hard-headed
business man. He’s doubtless right, for I
recall how once I battled in the marts of
trade and how futile were my efforts to be
like him, how weak and wavering were my
policies, until I saw I was too soft and pliant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
to contest with him, and with what grace
I could I then withdrew.</p>

<p>Since then, with what I have I live content.
A dog, a horse, a cow, a pig or two,
some fowl, and rabbits for full measure;
with these I need not traffic or exchange;
no trading this for that, no buying cheap
and selling dear, no asking more than what
I think is right. An empty life, you cry.
Mayhap for you, but not for me. It is a life
so full that half cannot be done.</p>

<p>And then, beside all these, a tiny house,
well filled with kindred souls. Of these no
words can tell, and it is well, for there are
things of which no man may speak.</p>

<p>But in the garden that enshrines the
house one may, with proper reverence,
rejoice. For here the very essence of it all
distills; here is the sign, the token of it all.</p>

<p>The sweet outdoors, the lure of husbandry;
restrained and gentle though it be;
the mystery of growth and fruitfulness; a
beauty changing every hour, each day; the
hours of tranquil joy and easy talk; the
twilight with its hint of old romance; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
nights, serene and fragrant, each with its
mood to fill my brimming cup!</p>

<p>And so I sum my blessings up, and as I
move about my small domain and visit each
familiar spot and see once more the flowers
and the beasts, in sheer content, with humble
mind and thankful heart, I call them
blessed, one and all.</p>

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
